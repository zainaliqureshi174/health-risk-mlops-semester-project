# Health Risk Prediction MLOps System

## Project Overview
End-to-end MLOps system for predicting respiratory illness using Federated Learning.

## Current Progress
- ✅ Data collection (365K records)
- ✅ EDA complete with visualizations
- ✅ Merged dataset ready for modeling

## Datasets
- Air Quality: 8,761 hourly records
- Weather: 8,761 hourly records  
- Wearable Health: 365,000 user-day records
- Health Outcomes: 365,000 labels (12.83% illness rate)

## Key Findings
- PM2.5 avg: 50.18 μg/m³
- Illness varies by city (12.5-13.6%)
- Correlations identified between environment and health

## Next Steps
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Federated data split
- [ ] Baseline models
- [ ] Federated learning implementation
